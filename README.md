# Machine_Learning_Simulation_Unity

Reinforcment learning simulation with my implementation of neural network.
Player characters avoids incoming obstacles, when less than 10% of player characters remains,
another generation based on remaining characters from previous generation get created.

Main script is Assets/Scripts/Enemy_Spawning.cs.
It controls both enemies (obstacles) as well as generation and training of player characters.
